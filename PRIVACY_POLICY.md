# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 31 December 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Bhagaur (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use BrightMinds Kids or visit our website.

Important summary: At the time of this release we do not collect personal information directly from users (for example: name, email address, phone number). In a future release we will enable internet access to display ads; third-party ad networks and their SDKs may collect device identifiers or other technical information — see "Ads and third parties" below.

## 1. Scope
- Applicability: This policy applies to personal data collected from users worldwide. Specific legal obligations may vary by jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 2. Information We Collect
- Data we do NOT collect: We do not collect personal information such as name, email address, postal address, or phone numbers from users in this release.
- Automatically collected technical data: the app may collect non-identifying technical information needed to operate the app (e.g., app version, crash reports, basic analytics, and aggregated usage statistics). These data are used only to improve the product.
- Ads & third-party collection: When internet-enabled ads are activated in a future release, third-party ad providers and ad networks integrated into the app may collect device identifiers, advertising identifiers (such as GAID/IDFA), IP addresses, and related information. The collection and use of such information is governed by those third parties' policies.
- Payment data: If you make purchases through a store (e.g., Google Play), payment processing is handled by the store or payment provider — we do not receive or store full card details.

## 3. How We Use Data
- Provide and maintain services
- Process payments
- Improve and personalize the product
- Security, fraud prevention, and legal compliance
- Marketing (with opt-in where required)

## 4. Legal Bases (where applicable)
- Performance of a contract
- Consent
- Legitimate interests
- Legal compliance

## 5. Data Sharing & Disclosures
- Service providers and subprocessors (hosting, analytics, payments)
- Legal requests (court order, law enforcement)
- Business transfers (M&A) — notice will be provided where possible

## 6. International Transfers
- Data may be transferred and processed in countries outside your jurisdiction. We will use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) where required.

## 7. Data Retention
- We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

## 8. Your Rights
- Because we do not collect personal information in this release, many data subject requests (access, rectification, deletion, portability) are not applicable. If you believe we hold personal data about you, contact: foisonpro@gmail.com and we will investigate.

## 9. Cookies & Tracking
- We currently do not set cookies for personalized tracking within the app. If ads or web-based features are enabled in future releases, cookies and similar technologies may be used by third-party providers. See `COOKIE_POLICY.md` for details.

## 10. Security
- We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures. See `SECURITY_POLICY.md`.

## 11. Children
- BrightMinds Kids is designed for children ages 2-6. We take children’s privacy very seriously.
- **No Data Collection from Children**: Our app does not knowingly collect, request, or store any personal information from children under the age of 13.
- **COPPA Compliance**: We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Since we do not collect personal data, we do not require parental consent for data collection.
- If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately at foisonpro@gmail.com.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
- We will post updates with a revised effective date.
