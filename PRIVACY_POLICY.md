# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 10 January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Bhagaur (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use BrightMinds Kids or visit our website.

Important summary: We do not collect personal information directly from users (such as name, email, or phone number). No login or sign-up is required. The app displays advertisements provided by third-party ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob), which may collect device or advertising identifiers to provide functional ad services in compliance with COPPA. — see "Ads and third parties" below.

## 1. Scope
- Applicability: This policy applies to personal data collected from users worldwide. Specific legal obligations may vary by jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## 2. Information We Collect
- Data we do NOT collect: We do not collect personal information such as name, email address, postal address, or phone numbers from users. No login, account creation, or sign-up is required to use the app.
- Automatically collected technical data: the app may collect non-identifying technical information needed to operate the app (e.g., app version, crash reports, basic analytics, and aggregated usage statistics). These data are used only to improve the product.
- Ads & third-party collection: The app displays ads. Third-party ad providers (such as Google AdMob) and ad networks integrated into the app may collect device identifiers, advertising identifiers (such as GAID/IDFA), IP addresses, and related technical information for the purpose of ad delivery, frequency capping, and performance measurement. The collection and use of such information is governed by those third parties' policies and complies with COPPA.
- Payment data: If you make purchases through a store (e.g., Google Play), payment processing is handled by the store or payment provider — we do not receive or store full card details.
