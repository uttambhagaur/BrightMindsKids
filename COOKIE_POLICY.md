# Cookie Policy

Effective date: 10 January 2026

This Cookie Policy explains how Bhagaur uses cookies and similar technologies on BrightMinds Kids and our website.

## 1. What are Cookies?
- Cookies are small text files stored on your device to remember preferences and activity.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use
- Current status: The app does not set first-party cookies for personalized tracking in this release.
- Essential: if the app integrates web components in the future, session cookies may be used to enable those features.
- Performance & Analytics: we may use basic, anonymized analytics to improve app stability. If enabled, these will be aggregated and non-identifying.
- Advertising & Tracking: The app uses device advertising identifiers (such as GAID/IDFA) for ad delivery, frequency capping, and measurement. These identifiers are controlled by the third-party ad providers (e.g., Google AdMob). See the provider opt-out links below.

## 3. Managing Cookies
- Mobile app controls: you can limit ad tracking or reset advertising identifiers through your device settings (e.g., Android "Opt out of Ads Personalization" or iOS "Limit Ad Tracking").
- Browser controls: for any web views, you can block or delete cookies via your browser settings.
- Opt-out links: for analytics and advertising providers, use their published opt-out tools (for example, Google Ad Settings and industry opt-out pages).

## 4. Changes
- We may update this policy; changes posted with a revised date.
